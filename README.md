# 🔐 Password Strength Evaluation

## 🎯 Objective
Understand what makes a password strong and test it against online password strength tools.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- [PasswordMeter](https://www.passwordmeter.com/)
- [NordPass Password Strength Checker](https://nordpass.com/password-strength-checker/)
- [Kaspersky Password Checker](https://password.kaspersky.com/)

## 🧪 Test Passwords

| Password         | Score (%) | Tool Feedback Summary                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `abc123`         | 25%       | Too short, lacks complexity, common pattern.                                          |
| `Password@1`     | 65%       | Medium strength, common word used, but includes symbol and digit.                     |
| `P@55w0rD!23`    | 90%       | Strong – includes upper/lowercase, digits, symbols, and good length.                 |
| `qwerty`         | 20%       | Very weak – keyboard pattern, no complexity.                                          |
| `Th!s1s$ecur3`   | 95%       | Very strong – long, contains mix of character types, hard to guess.                  |

## 📌 Tips Learned for Creating Strong Passwords
- Use at least 12 characters or more.
- Combine **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **symbols**.
- Avoid dictionary words, keyboard patterns (like `qwerty`), or common substitutions (`P@ssw0rd`).
- Do not reuse passwords across websites.
- Consider using a **passphrase** (e.g., `D0g$Eat#TunaS@lad!`) for better memorability and strength.

## 🧠 Password Attack Methods (Brief Overview)

### 1. **Brute Force Attack**
Tries every possible character combination. Long and complex passwords take more time to crack.

### 2. **Dictionary Attack**
Uses a list of commonly used passwords and dictionary words. Simple or commonly used words are easily cracked.

### 3. **Credential Stuffing**
Attackers use leaked username/password pairs from previous breaches. Password reuse makes you highly vulnerable.

## 🧩 How Password Complexity Affects Security
- Complexity **increases entropy**, making passwords harder to guess.
- A long, random, and complex password can take **millions of years** to brute force.
- Weak or reused passwords make you an easy target in cyber attacks.

## ✅ Conclusion
Through testing, it is evident that password **length**, **diversity in characters**, and **randomness** play a critical role in password strength. Using strong passwords and avoiding predictable patterns greatly reduces the risk of compromise.
